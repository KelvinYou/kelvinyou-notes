# Ideal Working Environment

This is about the work environment I want to have, with layout priorities from high to low.

## What will attract me?

1. **Comfortable Working Area**
    - Generally what I need is 2 screens (monitor + monitor/laptop screen), better processor and enough memory (mobile development requires higher memory)
    - good lighting
    - comfort temperature
    - macOS (only if I need to develop ios applications)
1. **Continuous Improvement**
    - Have a group of motivated colleagues
    - a senior who can guide me
    - Hold meetings to discuss ideas with each other
1. **Flexible Working Time & Shorter Commute**
    - better if can work hybrid (prefer 3+2), sometimes in office, sometimes work from home
    - flexible一点，新年除夕让我们可选择wfh - 原因是因为新年时刻也没人有mood做工，要是可选择wfh会更好，午餐能和家人吃团圆饭，空闲时间可以继续上班，相对而言性价比更高
    - 公司附近有public transport能快速抵达 / 车辆不拥堵
1. **Effective and Efficient Communication**
    - effective meeting

## What I don't like?

1. **Invalid and malicious (恶意) overtime**
1. **Invalid meeting**
    - Minimize meetings as much as possible so as not to waste everyone’s time

# Introduction

:::note

This is a place to record my life lessons and personal growth, things I feel motivated about, things that improve my thinking, etc.

:::

## Why I create this notes?

1. For my future reference
    - no one can always remember everything they have learned and done before.

2. Improve my English writing skills and English vocabulary
    - Doing research or writing notes can improve my English vocabulary, summarizing skills and expression skills

3. For sharing
    - Everyone is welcome to refer to my notes. If you have any comments, please feel free to contact me.

<summary>3 Strengths and 3 Weaknesses</summary>


### Strengths

    - try my best to write a clean code

1. Love researching new technologies
    - Very interested in what new technology can do

### Weaknesses

1. Perfectionism
    - I will always try to make my code looks perfect. For example, will think about whether have is there any better
      - variable names, 
      - structure,
      - architect, and so on.
    - It's usually very time consuming, so lately I've been trying to tell myself that completion is more important than perfection. As long as the code is clean enough or even if it's not clean enough, it can be enhanced again later.

## Exercises

<details>

<summary>What makes you unique?</summary>

My ability to understand the tasks given and the overall application structure. In my previous role, I would often know the code for the part I was responsible for in advance so that I could master it more quickly when I was given the task. Sometimes I can provide better suggestions in a timely manner when discussing solutions with the product team.

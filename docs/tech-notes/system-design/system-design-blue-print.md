We've created a template to tackle various system design problems in interviews.

Hope this checklist is useful to guide your discussions during the interview process.

This briefly touches on the following discussion points:
- Load Balancing
- API Gateway
- Communication Protocols
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Database
- Cache
- Message Queue
- Unique ID Generation
- Scalability
- Availability
- Performance
- Security
- Fault Tolerance and Resilience
- And more

## [Load Balancing](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/)

Load balancing is a technique used to `distribute network or application traffic` across `multiple servers`. This distribution helps enhance the `responsiveness and availability` of applications. It plays a pivotal (关键的) role in `managing large volumes of user requests`, `preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck`.

### Types & Techniques

- **Hardware vs. Software Load Balancers**: Hardware load balancers are dedicated appliances, whereas software load balancers are more flexible and can run on commodity hardware.

- **Load Balancing Algorithms**: Common algorithms include round-robin, where requests are distributed sequentially; least connections, which routes traffic to the server with the fewest active connections; and IP hash, which assigns user requests based on IP address.

## API Gateway

API gateway acts as the front-door for all API requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservices and aggregates the results into cohesive responses.

### Functionality

- **Request Routing**: Directs incoming requests to the correct microservices.
- **Protocol Translation**: Converts various protocol formats to ensure seamless communication between disparate services.

## Communication Protocols

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: The foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
- **WebSocket**: Enables two-way interactive communication sessions between the user's browser and a server.
- **MQTT**: Lightweight messaging protocol, ideal for IoT devices.

## Content Delivery Network (CDN)

CDNs `cache content` in various locations closer to the end-users (edge servers). This `reduces latency` since requests are served from the nearest location.

### Implementation Strategies

- **Push vs. Pull CDNs**: Push CDNs require content to be manually pushed to the CDN servers, while pull CDNs automatically cache content based on user requests.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Efficient cache invalidation strategies are crucial for ensuring users receive the most updated content.

## Database

### Types of Databases

- **SQL Databases**: Use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. Ideal for complex queries and ACID transactions.
- **NoSQL Databases**: More flexible in terms of schema and typically offer horizontal scaling. Useful for large sets of distributed data.

### Design Considerations

- **Schema Design**: Involves structuring data optimally for query efficiency.
- **Indexing**: Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval but require careful management as they can slow down write operations.

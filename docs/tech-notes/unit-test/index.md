# Unit Test

## Manual vs. automated unit testing
Developers can perform unit tests manually or automatically. Those employing a manual method may have an instinctual document made detailing each step in the process; however, automated testing is the more common method for unit testing. Automated approaches commonly use a testing framework to develop test cases. These frameworks are also set to flag and report any failed test cases while also providing a summary of test cases.

## Unit testing advantages

* The earlier a problem is identified, the fewer compound errors occur.
* Fixing problems early is usually cheaper than fixing them later in development.
* Easier debugging processes.
* Developers can quickly make changes to the codebase.
* Developers can reuse code and migrate it to new projects.

## Unit testing disadvantages

* More lines of test code may need to be written to test one line of code
* Unit tests only test sets of data and its functionality
* Developers may have to learn new skills to implement unit testing correctly

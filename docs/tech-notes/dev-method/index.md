# System Development Methodology

When it comes to system design methodologies in Malaysia, there is no single dominant methodology that is universally adopted. However, some popular methodologies used by software development teams and organizations in Malaysia include:

## Agile Methodologies

![Agile](https://solutions.trustradius.com/wp-content/uploads/agile-and-waterfall-are-two-distinctive-methodologies-of-processes-to-vector-id1402640559-999x1000.jpg)

- Scrum: Scrum is a widely used Agile methodology that emphasizes iterative and incremental development, with a focus on self-organizing teams and continuous improvement.
- Kanban: Kanban is a lean methodology that focuses on visualizing the workflow, limiting work in progress, and optimizing the flow of work.

| Aspect | Scrum | Kanban |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Work Cycle | Iterations (Sprints) with fixed duration | Continuous flow of work |
| Roles | Defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team) | Roles not strictly defined |
| Ceremonies | Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-up, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective | No specific ceremonies |
| Backlog | Sprint Backlog, Product Backlog | Single prioritized backlog |
| Focus | Delivering a potentially shippable increment at the end of each Sprint | Optimizing workflow and reducing bottlenecks |
| Work Progress | Time-boxed Sprints | Continuous delivery and improvement |
| Structure | Higher level of ceremony and structure | Lightweight and focuses on visualization |
| Work Visualization | Uses boards or visual representations | Visualizes workflow and limits work in progress (WIP) |
| Feedback and Adaptation | Encourages frequent feedback and adaptation | Encourages frequent feedback and adaptation |

Key Differences:

- Scrum has defined roles, ceremonies, and time-boxed Sprints, while Kanban has a more flexible and continuous flow of work.
- Scrum emphasizes iterations and delivering a potentially shippable increment, while Kanban emphasizes optimizing the workflow and reducing bottlenecks.
- Scrum has a higher level of ceremony and structure, while Kanban is more lightweight and focuses on visualization and limiting WIP.
- Scrum uses separate Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog, while Kanban typically has a single prioritized backlog.

Similarities:

- Both are Agile methodologies that promote transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
- Both methodologies use boards or visual representations to track work items and their progress.
- Both methodologies encourage frequent feedback and adaptation to changing requirements.

The choice between Scrum and Kanban often depends on the project's nature, team preferences, and organizational culture. Scrum may be more suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and a need for regular releases, while Kanban can be a better fit for projects with a continuous flow of work and a focus on optimizing processes.

It's also common for organizations to combine elements from both methodologies or use a hybrid approach, known as "Scrumban," to leverage the strengths of both Scrum and Kanban.

## Waterfall Model

While Agile methodologies are gaining popularity, the traditional Waterfall model is still used in some organizations, particularly for projects with well-defined requirements and strict timelines.

## Rapid Application Development (RAD)

RAD is a methodology that emphasizes rapid prototyping and iterative development, with the goal of delivering high-quality software products in a shorter timeframe.

## Unified Process (UP)

The Unified Process is an iterative and incremental software development process that combines elements from various methodologies, including Agile practices.

## Rational Unified Process (RUP)

RUP is a Software Engineering Process, which provides a disciplined approach to assigning tasks and responsibilities within a development organization. It is a software development methodology based on the Unified Process.

## V-Model

The V-Model is a sequential path of execution of processes, where each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin. It is often used in projects with strict documentation requirements and rigorous testing processes.

## Summary

It's important to note that many organizations in Malaysia adopt a hybrid approach, combining elements from different methodologies to suit their specific project requirements, team dynamics, and organizational culture. Additionally, the choice of methodology may depend on factors such as project size, complexity, and industry domain.

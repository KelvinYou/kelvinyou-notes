## 1. Agile

- terative and Incremental: Development is broken down into small, iterative cycles (sprints) with a focus on delivering working software incrementally.
- Collaborative Approach: Emphasis on collaboration between cross-functional teams and close interaction with stakeholders.
- Adaptive to Change: Able to accommodate changes and feedback throughout the development process.
- Customer-Centric: Prioritizes customer satisfaction and delivering value early and often.
- Scrum and Kanban: Two popular frameworks within Agile, with Scrum using fixed-length iterations and Kanban focusing on continuous flow.



## 2. Scrum

- Empirical Process Control: Based on the principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
- Roles: Defined roles including Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
- Artifacts: Uses artifacts such as Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment.
- Time-Boxed Sprints: Fixed-length iterations (typically 2-4 weeks) with a focus on delivering a potentially shippable product increment.
- Daily Stand-ups: Regular meetings to synchronize and plan work.



## 3. Kanban

- Visual Management: Focuses on visualizing work items on a Kanban board and limiting work in progress (WIP).
- Continuous Flow: Work items move through stages of the workflow in a continuous manner, with a focus on minimizing lead time and cycle time.
- Pull-Based System: Work is pulled into the system based on capacity and demand.
- No Prescribed Roles or Time-Boxes: Offers flexibility in team structure and process.

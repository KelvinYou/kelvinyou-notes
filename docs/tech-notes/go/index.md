## [What is Go?](https://go.dev)
- Go is a cross-platform, open source programming language
- Go can be used to create high-performance applications
- Go is a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language
- Go was developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007
- Go's syntax is similar to C++

## What is Go Used For?

- Web development (server-side)
- Developing network-based programs
- Developing cross-platform enterprise applications
- Cloud-native development

## Why Use Go?
- Go is fun and easy to learn
- Go has fast run time and compilation time
- Go supports concurrency
- Go has memory management
- Go works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

## Six Main Points about Go

1. Statically Typed Language
1. Strongly Typed Language
1. GO is Compiled (faster than python 120x)
1. Fast Compile Time
1. Built In Concurrency (Goroutines)
1. Simplicity 

## Go - Pros and Cons

Pros   
- Easy to learn/use    
- Simple!
- Great concurrency support

Cons
- not as performant
- not memory safe

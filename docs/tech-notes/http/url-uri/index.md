# URL vs URI

URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences in terms of structure and functionality.

## Structure:
- A URL is a specific type of URI that provides the location of a resource on the internet. It consists of a protocol (e.g., http, https), followed by the domain name or IP address, and optional path, query parameters, and fragment identifier.
- A URI, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses both URLs and URNs (Uniform Resource Names). URIs can identify any resource, whether it is located on the internet or not.

## Example:
- URL: https://www.example.com/path/to/resource?param=value#fragment
- URI: urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4

## Key Points:
- URLs are used to locate resources on the internet, while URIs can identify any resource.
- URLs have a specific structure that includes a protocol, domain name, and optional path, query parameters, and fragment identifier.
- URIs have a broader structure that can include various schemes, such as urn, http, ftp, etc.
- URLs are more commonly used in web development for linking to web pages, images, APIs, etc.
- URIs are used for identifying resources, such as ISBN numbers, namespaces, etc.

Remember to use the appropriate term (URL or URI) based on the context and the specific requirements of your project.

# Jenkins Introduction

## 1. What is Jenkins?
- Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate the non-human part of the software development process.
- It is primarily used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) pipelines.

## 2. Key Features of Jenkins:
- **Continuous Integration**: Jenkins can automatically build and test code changes, providing immediate feedback to developers.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**: Jenkins can automate the process of delivering and deploying applications to different environments (staging, production, etc.).
- **Plugins**: Jenkins has a vast ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality for various tools and technologies.
- **Distributed Builds**: Jenkins supports distributed builds across multiple machines, enabling faster build times.
- **Web Interface**: Jenkins provides a user-friendly web interface for configuring and monitoring jobs.
- **Pipeline as Code**: Jenkins can define entire pipelines as code using the Pipeline DSL or Jenkinsfile.

## 3. Jenkins Architecture:
- **Jenkins Master**: The central management and coordination component that controls the overall process.
- **Jenkins Slave/Agent**: A remote machine or container that executes build tasks delegated by the Jenkins Master.
- **Jobs**: A configurable project that defines the steps to be executed (e.g., build, test, deploy).
- **Plugins**: Extensions that provide additional functionality and integrations with different tools and technologies.

## 4. Key Components:
- **Pipeline**: A collection of steps defined in code that automates the entire software delivery process.
- **Build Triggers**: Mechanisms that trigger a build, such as code commits, scheduled times, or external events.
- **Build Steps**: Individual tasks or commands executed during a build (e.g., compiling code, running tests, creating artifacts).
- **Post-Build Actions**: Actions performed after a build completes, such as archiving artifacts or sending notifications.

## 5. Getting Started with Jenkins:
- Install Jenkins on a server or use a cloud-hosted solution.
- Access the Jenkins web interface and create your first job.
- Configure the job with the desired build steps, triggers, and post-build actions.
- Integrate Jenkins with your Version Control System (VCS) like Git or SVN.
- Use plugins to extend Jenkins' functionality (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.).

## 6. Use Cases:
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment pipelines.
- Building and testing applications across various platforms and environments.
- Automating software release processes and deployments.
- Integrating with various tools and technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, etc.).

# Local Storage and Session Storage

**Local Storage**:
- **Scope**: Local Storage is designed to persist data across browser sessions. It remains stored even after the browser is closed and reopened.
- **Storage Limit**: The storage capacity is typically higher than Session Storage, allowing for larger amounts of data to be stored (usually up to 5MB per origin).
- **Lifetime**: Data stored in Local Storage remains until explicitly cleared by the user or through script execution.
- **Usage**: It's commonly used for storing user preferences, settings, authentication tokens, and other application data that needs to persist across multiple sessions.
- **Accessibility**: Data stored in Local Storage is accessible across all tabs and windows opened from the same origin.

**Session Storage**:
- **Scope**: Session Storage is designed to store data for the duration of a browser session. Once the session ends (e.g., when the browser is closed), the data is cleared.
- **Storage Limit**: It typically has a smaller storage capacity compared to Local Storage (usually up to 5MB per origin), but this limit is per session.
- **Lifetime**: Data stored in Session Storage is cleared when the browser session ends, either by closing the tab or the entire browser.
- **Usage**: Session Storage is suitable for storing temporary data that is only needed for the current session, such as shopping cart items, form data, or transient application state.
- **Accessibility**: Similar to Local Storage, data stored in Session Storage is accessible across all tabs and windows opened from the same origin, but it's scoped to the current session.

In summary, Local Storage is best suited for storing data that needs to persist across browser sessions, while Session Storage is ideal for storing data that is only needed for the duration of the current browser session. Both provide a convenient way to store client-side data without the need for server-side storage.

# Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

## What is SEO?
SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, SEO means the process of improving your website to increase its visibility in search engines (Google, Microsoft Bing, etc) whenever people search for:
- Products you sell.
- Services you provide.
- Information on topics in which you have deep expertise and/or experience.

The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to be found and clicked on. Ultimately, the goal of search engine optimization is to help attract website visitors who will become customers, clients or an audience that keeps coming back.

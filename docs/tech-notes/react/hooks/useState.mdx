# React - useState


[useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.

```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
```

In my experience it is mainly used when the current component needs to be re-rendered to make some changes to the UI

## Reference

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(28);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Kelvin');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => createTodos());
  // ...
```

<summary>Markdown is declarative</summary>

Some may assume a 1-1 correlation between Markdown and HTML, e.g., `![Preview](/img/docusaurus.png)` will always become `<img src="/img/docusaurus.png" alt="Preview" />`, as-is. However, _that is not the case_.

The Markdown syntax `![message](url)` only declaratively tells Docusaurus that an image needs to be inserted here, but we may do other things like transforming a [file path to URL path](./markdown-features-assets.mdx#images), so the generated markup may differ from the output of other Markdown renderers, or a naÃ¯ve hand-transcription to the equivalent JSX/HTML code.

In general, you should only assume the _semantics_ of the markup (` ``` ` fences become [code blocks](./markdown-features-code-blocks.mdx); `>` becomes [quotes](#quotes), etc.), but not the actual compiled output.

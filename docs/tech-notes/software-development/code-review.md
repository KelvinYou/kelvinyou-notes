# Code Review

## Code Review Step

1. **Determine the purpose**:
   - This section is good and covers the essential questions to ask before starting a code review.

2. **Use project management software**:
   - Instead of mentioning a specific tool (Wrike), it would be better to provide a more generic explanation, as different teams may use different project management or code review tools.
   - You could mention examples of popular tools like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps, which have built-in code review functionalities.

3. **Review the code as a "code breaker"**:
   - This section is well-explained and highlights the importance of considering edge cases, performance, and potential issues.

4. **Determine if the code can be maintained**:
   - You could expand this section by including other aspects of maintainable code, such as:
     - Adherence to coding standards and best practices
     - Proper use of comments and documentation
     - Separation of concerns
     - Testability

5. **Vet for security**:
   - This section is good, but you could also mention the importance of following secure coding practices and guidelines specific to the programming language or framework being used.
   - Additionally, you could highlight the need for regular security audits and the use of automated security scanning tools.

6. **Communicate with the coder**:
   - This section is well-written and emphasizes the importance of constructive feedback and open communication.
   - You could also mention the importance of providing specific examples or references to support your feedback, as well as encouraging the coder to ask questions or seek clarification if needed.

7. **Additional sections**:
   - You could consider adding a section on the importance of having a well-defined code review process and guidelines within the team or organization.
   - Another useful section could cover the role of automation in code reviews, such as using static code analysis tools, linters, or formatting tools to catch common issues and enforce coding standards.

8. **Examples and illustrations**:
   - To make the notes more engaging and easier to understand, you could consider adding relevant examples, diagrams, or screenshots to illustrate certain points or concepts.

# GraphQL

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is an open source query language for APIs. GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to the traditional REST API. Clients define the structure of the response with their query. This ensures no over-fetching or under-fetching of data. Every GraphQL service defines a set of types which describe the set of possible data. You use these types to guarantee that the server only returns valid data. GraphQL is not tied to any specific database or storage engine. It is backed by your existing code and data.
